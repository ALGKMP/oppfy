            <p>
              The Service provides functionality that allows you to invite your
              friends to download the OPPFY mobile application. In order to do
              so, you must affirmatively select the friends you would like to
              invite to join the OPPFY community. You must provide the telephone
              number associated with your friends' wireless devices in order to
              invite them to join OPPFY.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can either manually provide the number during the invitation
              process or select from your contacts the individuals you would
              like to invite. There is a standard, non-commercial text message
              that the people you invite will receive with an active link that
              when selected will allow those people to download the free OPPFY
              mobile application.
            </p>
            <p>
              YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT EACH PERSON YOU INVITE HAS
              CONSENTED TO RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES FROM YOU INCLUDING THE
              INVITATIONAL TEXT MESSAGE YOU ELECT TO SEND INVITING YOUR FRIENDS
              TO DOWNLOAD THE OPPFY MOBILE APPLICATION.

            </h2>
            <p>
              As part of the Service, we cause informational messages to be sent
              to those parties that you tag in a photo on OPPFY. Specifically,
              once you elect to tag a person in a photo, we will send an
              informational text message to the person you tagged. The
              informational text messages that we cause to be sent will include
              instructions on how recipients can stop receiving such text
              messages from OPPFY.

            </h2>
            <p>
              There are no fees charged by us to use the Service. However, text
              messages sent and received by you, or by us on behalf of you, may
              be subject to standard text messaging rates if you or the
              recipient does not have a plan allowing for unlimited text
              messages from your mobile wireless carrier. Such fees could apply
              both to sending and receiving text messages. Please contact your
              underlying carrier to determine whether there are fees associated
              with text messages as part of your plan and for information as to
              the cost for such text messages if you have any questions.
