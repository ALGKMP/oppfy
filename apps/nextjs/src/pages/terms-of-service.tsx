      <h2>Last Updated: July 20, 2024</h2>

      <h2>1. AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND</h2>
      <p>
        Please read these Terms of Service (“Terms,” “Terms of Service”)
        carefully before using the OPPFY mobile application (the “Service”)
        operated by ALGKMP (“ALGKMP,” “us”, “we”, or “our”). These Terms include
        a provision for dispute resolution, requiring that both you and ALGKMP
        agree to resolve disputes through mandatory arbitration, and that we
        both waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or
        class-wide arbitration. Your access to and use of the Service is
        conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms and
        to be bound by them. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and
        others who wish to access or use the Service. By accessing or using the
        Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any
        part of the Terms, then you do not have permission to access the
        Service. We may amend the Terms from time to time and we will provide
        notice of any material changes on www.oppfy.app and, if we have an email
        address for you, we will send you an email advising you of any material
        changes to the Terms. Continued use of the Service constitutes
        acceptance of any amendments to the Terms. This Service is available
        only to those individuals who are the age of majority in their relevant
        jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <h2>2. COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
      <p>
        By creating an Account on our service, you agree to subscribe to
        newsletters, marketing or promotional materials, and other information
        we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these
        communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions
        provided in any email we send.
      </p>

      <h2>3. CONSENT TO SEND TEXT MESSAGES</h2>
      <p>
        The Service provides functionality that allows you to invite your
        friends to download the OPPFY mobile application. In order to do so, you
        must affirmatively select the friends you would like to invite to join
        the OPPFY community. You must provide the telephone number associated
        with your friends’ wireless devices in order to invite them to join
        OPPFY. You can either manually provide the number during the invitation
        process or select from your contacts the individuals you would like to
        invite. There is a standard, non-commercial text message that the people
        you invite will receive with an active link that when selected will
        allow those people to download the free OPPFY mobile application. You
        can also customize the invitational text but an active link will be
        included in your message to ease the download of the free OPPFY mobile
        application. You acknowledge that you understand that when you send
        invitational text messages to the people you invite to join the Service
        you are considered the sender of the text message under relevant law.
        YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT EACH PERSON YOU INVITE HAS CONSENTED TO
        RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES FROM YOU INCLUDING THE INVITATIONAL TEXT MESSAGE
        YOU ELECT TO SEND INVITING YOUR FRIENDS TO DOWNLOAD THE OPPFY MOBILE
        APPLICATION.
      </p>

      <h2>4. TEXT MESSAGES SENT BY OPPFY</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the Service, we cause informational messages to be sent to
        those parties that you tag in a photo on OPPFY. Specifically, once you
        elect to tag a person in a photo, we will send an informational text
        message to the person you tagged. The informational text messages that
        we cause to be sent will include instructions on how recipients can stop
        receiving such text messages from OPPFY. BY SIGNING UP TO USE THE
        SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES FROM OPPFY AND YOU REPRESENT
        AND WARRANT THAT EACH PERSON YOU TAG IN A PHOTO HAS CONSENTED TO RECEIVE
        TEXT MESSAGES FROM US.
      </p>

      <h2>5. TEXT MESSAGE FEES</h2>
      <p>
        There are no fees charged by us to use the Service. However, text
        messages sent and received by you, or by us on behalf of you, may be
        subject to standard text messaging rates if you or the recipient does
        not have a plan allowing for unlimited text messages from your mobile
        wireless carrier. Such fees could apply both to sending and receiving
        text messages. Please contact your underlying carrier to determine
        whether there are fees associated with text messages as part of your
        plan and for information as to the cost for such text messages if you
        have any questions.
      </p>
