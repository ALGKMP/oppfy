        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
      <p>
        In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill
        the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required
        by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days
        past the termination of the user's account.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this
        is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
        stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
        information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
        possible.
      </p>

      <h3>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
      <p>
        In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system
        of organizational and technical security measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
        process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the
        internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect
        your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
        from our Apps is at your own risk. You should only access the services
        within a secure environment.
      </p>

      <h3>6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
      <p>
        In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we
        are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the
        right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.
        You can find their contact details here:{" "}

          http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may
        email us at hello@oppfy.app.
      </p>

      <h3>Account Information</h3>
      <p>
        If you would at any time like to review or change the information in
        your account or terminate your account, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Log into your account settings and update your user account.</li>
        <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or
        delete your account and information from our active databases. However,
        some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud,
        troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms
        of Use and/or comply with legal requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opting out of email marketing:</strong> You can unsubscribe from
        our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link
        in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details
        provided below. You will then be removed from the marketing email list –
        however, we will still need to send you service-related emails that are
        necessary for the administration and use of your account. To otherwise
        opt-out, you may:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Note your preferences when you register an account with the site.
        </li>
        <li>Access your account settings and update preferences.</li>
        <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. DATA BREACH</h3>
      <p>
        A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or
        collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal information. You
        will be notified about data breaches when Oppfy by ALGKMP Inc. believes
        you are likely to be at risk or serious harm. For example, a data breach
        may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental
        or physical well-being. In the event that Oppfy by ALGKMP Inc. becomes
        aware of a security breach which has resulted or may result in
        unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information Oppfy by
        ALGKMP Inc. will promptly investigate the matter and notify the
        applicable Supervisory Authority no later than 72 hours after having
        become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to
        result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
      </p>

      <h3>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
        technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
        been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h3>9. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS</h3>
      <p>
        In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted
        specific rights regarding access to your personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The
        Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request
